MapleQuest posiTIVA provides an online interface to pharmacokinetic (PK)
simulations relevant to anesthesiology.  It is a learning and teaching
tool intended to further the understanding of pharmacokinetic properties
of drugs commonly used in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). It is not
a medical device, and should not be relied upon for any clinical decisions.

posiTIVA does not perform PK calculations
itself, but rather runs an unmodified subset of the
[stanpumpR](https://github.com/StevenLShafer/stanpumpR) R language source
code in a WebR WebAssembly environment. stanpumpR performs pharmacokinetic
simulations based on mathematical models published in the peer-reviewed
literature.

Development of MapleQuest posiTIVA is supported in part by the 2023 World Federation
of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Fresenius-Kabi Innovation Award
and the 2024 Society for Technology in Anesthesia Research Grant.
